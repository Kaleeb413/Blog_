    <p>Can you see?
Yeah.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
How about now?
Can you see now?
All right.
Ready? Three fingers.
Nice!
Nice throw, kiddo!
Go.
Hey, you guys want mayo
or mustard, or both?
Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
Pardon your brothers. Two mustards, please!
Thanks, momma.
Got it.
Nate, mayo or mustard?
I want ketchup.
Mind your elbow...
Good job, Hawkeye!
Go get your arrow.
Hey, guys. Enough practice.
Soup's on.
All right. We're coming.
We're hungry.
Lila, let's go.
Lila?
Honey?
Babe?
Babe?
Babe?
Boys!
Boys?
Laura!
You don't need to do that,
because you're just
holding the position.
Come on.
That was close.
That's a goal. We're
now one a-piece.
I would like to try again.
We're tied up.
Feel the tension? It's fun.
That was terrible. Now you
have a chance to win.
And you won. Congratulations.
Fair game.
Good sport.
You had fun?
It was fun.
This thing on?
Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.
If you find this recording...
don't post it, on social media.
It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.
I don't even know
if you're still...
Oh, God. I hope so...
Today is day 21... uh, 22.
You know, if it wasn't for
the existensial terror of
staring into the
literal void of space,
I'd say, I'm feeling
more better today.
The infection's run its course,
thanks to the blue meanie back there.
You'd love her. Very practical.
Only a tiny bit sadistic.
Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but
we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge
to buy ourselves, about,
48 hours of playtime.
But it's now dead in the water.
We're 1,000 lightyears
from the nearest 7-11.
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning.
That'll be it.
And Pep, I...
I know I said no
more surprises, but
I gotta say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.
But it looks like...
Well, you know what
it looks like.
Don't feel bad about this.
I mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks,
and then, move on
with enormous guilt.
I should probably lie down.
I'm gonna caress my
Please know that...
When I drift off, it will be
goodbye the whole time...
I'll think about you.
Because it's always you.
- Couldn't stop him.
- Neither could I.
I lost the kid.
Tony, we lost.
Is, umm...
Oh, my God!
It's okay.
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.
World governments are in pieces.
The parts that are still working
are trying to take a census,
And it looks like he did...
He did exactly what he said he
was gonna do. Thanos wiped out..
...fifty percent of
all living creatures.
Where is he now? Where?
We don't know.
He just opened a portal
and walked through.
What's wrong with him?
He's pissed.
He thinks he failed.
Which of course he did, but there's a
lot of that goin' around, ain't there?
Honestly, at this exact second, I
thought you were a Build-A-Bear.
Maybe I am.
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.
Deep space scans, and
satellites, and we got nothing.
- Tony you fought him.
- Who told you that?
Didn't fight him.
No. He wiped my face
with a planet while a
Bleecker Street magician
gave away the stone.</p>
