    <P>No.
- That's what you want.
- How did you find this?
- Garage.
Really?
- Were you looking for it?
- No.
I found it, though.
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.
Now, we know what
it sounds like...
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?
Thank you.
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.
- I did.
- No.
You accidentally survived. It's a---
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?
I don't believe we would.
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.
That means no talking to our past selves,
no betting on sporting events...
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.
'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's
not how quantum physics works.
Tony...
We have to take a stand.
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.
And you're telling me
that you won't even...
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.
Got a kid.
Mommy told me to
come and save you.
Good job. I'm saved.
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.
Anything else. Honestly, I
missed you guys, it was...
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.
But this is a second chance.
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.
I can't roll the dice again.
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?
No. I wanna do it right.
We're gonna need a
really big brain.
Bigger than his?
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating. Try some of that.
Have some eggs.
I'm so confused.
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.
I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.
Come on, step on up. You mind?
Oh.
- Say "green."
- Green.
Greeeen.
- Did you get that?
- That's good.
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...
You want to take a
picture with him, right?
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the goddamn phone.
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.
- Dab.
- Bruce.
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.
- About we were saying...
- Right.
The whole time travel do-over?
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.
Well, you pulled this off.
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?
Processing...
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.
- Gotta take a second.
- Just a moment.
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...
Model rendered.
Shit!
Shit!
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?
- Shit.
- No. We don't say that.
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.
Why you up?
'Cause I got some important shit
going on here. What do you think?
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.
That's extortion.
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...
my mind.
You done? Yeah? Now you are.
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.
A story.
Once upon a time, a little
