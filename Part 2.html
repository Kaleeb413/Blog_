    <p>That's what happened. There was no fight...
- Okay.
Did he give you any clues?
Any coordinates, anything?
Pfft!
I saw this coming a few years back. I had
a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.
Thought I was dreaming.
- Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.
- And I needed you.
As in past tense. That trumps what
you need. It's too late, buddy.
Sorry.
You know what I need?
I need to shave.
- And I believe I rememeber telling
- Tony, Tony, Tony...
why that otherwise,
that what we needed was a suit of armor
around the world. Remember that?
Whether it impacted our precious
freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.
- Well that didn't work out, did it?
- I said we'd lose.
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."
Well guess what, Cap? We lost.
You weren't there.
But that's what we do, right?
Our best work after the fact?
We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?
Okay. You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?
- No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.
- Tony, sit, sit down!
We need you. You're new blood.
Bunch of tired old mills...
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,
no clues, no strategies,
no options...
Zero. Zip. Nada. No
trust, you liar...
Here, take this. You find
him and you put that on.
You hide.
- Tony!
- I'm fine. I...
Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna
probably be out for the rest of the day.
You guys take care of him. And I'll bring
an Bezurian elixir when I come back.
- Where are you going?
- To kill Thanos.
Hey.
You know we usually work
as a team here, and
between you and I we're
also a little fragile.
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight, too.
- You even know where he is?
- I know people who might.
Don't bother.
I can tell you where Thanos is.
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.
Then when he worked, he
talked about his great plan.
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.
I'd ask, where would we go
once his plan was complete?
His answer was always the same.
To The Garden.
That's cute. Thanos has
a retirement plan.
So where is he, then?
When Thanos snapped his fingers,
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.
No one's ever seen anything like it...
until two days ago.
On this planet.
Thanos is there.
He used the stones again.
Hey, hey, hey...
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?
- Look, he still got the stones, so...
- So let's get him.
- We use them to bring everyone back.
- Just like that?
Yeah. Just like that.
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?
Because before, you
didn't have me.
Hey, new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.
I like this one.
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.
Okay. Who here hasn't
been to space?
You better not throw
up on my ship.
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.
I'll head down for recon.
- This is gonna work Steve.
- I know it will.
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.
No satellites, no ships, no armies,
no ground defenses of any kind.
It's just him.
Then that's enough.
Oh, no.
Where are they?
Answer the question.
The universe
required correction.
After that, the stones served
no purpose, beyond temptation.
You murdered trillions!
You should be grateful.
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.
I used the stones to
destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.
But the work is done.
It always will be.
I am inevitable.
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.
My father is many things.
A liar is not one of them.
Thank you, Daughter.
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...
What... what did you do?
I went for the head.
So I, uh...
Went on a date the other day.
It's the first time in five years,
you know? Sit there, dinner...
I didn't know what
to talk about.
What did you talk about?
Same old crap, you know? How
things have changed, and...
My job, his job....
How much we miss the Mets.
Then things get quiet..
He cried as they were
serving the salads.
What about you?
I cried just before dessert.
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...
That's great.
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump, you
didn't know where you
were gonna come down.
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps you gotta take.
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.
I went in the ice in '45 right
after I met the love of my life.
Woke up 70 years later.
You got to move on.
Got to move on.
The world is in our hands.
It's left to us guys.
And we got to do
something with it.
Otherwise...
Thanos should've
killed all of us.
What the hell?
Hope?
Kid! Hey, kid!
What the hell happened here?
My God...
No. Please. Please, please.
No, no, no...
Excuse me. Sorry.
No, Cassie, no.
No.
No, no.
Please, please,
please, please....
No, Cassie...
What?
Cassie?
Dad?
You're so big!
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.
It was an infectious
garbage scowl.
So, thanks for the hot tip.
- Well, you were closer.
- Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.
You get a reading
on those tremors?
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.
Do we have a visual? How
are we handling it?
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.
We handle it by not handling it.
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?
- Not likely.
- What, you gonna get another haircut?
Listen, fur-face. I'm
covering a lot of territory.
The things that are
happening on Earth are
happening everywhere, on
thousands of planets.
That's a good point.
That's a good point.
So you might not see
me for a long time.
All right. Uh, well...
This channel is always active.
So, anything goes sideways...
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...
- Comes through me.
- Okay.
All right.
Good luck.
- Where are you?
- Mexico.
The federales found a
room full of bodies.
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never
even had the chance to get their guns off.
- It's probably a rival gang...
- Except it isn't.
It's definitely Barton.
What he's done here, what he's
been doing for the last few years,
I mean, the scene
that he left...
I gotta tell you, there's a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.
Will you find out where
he's going next?
Nat...
Please.
Okay.
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already.
You here to do your laundry?
And to see a friend.
Clearly, your friend is fine.
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships, cleaner water.
You know, if you're about to tell
me to look on the bright side...
Um...
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.
Sorry. Force of habit.
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and... grow.
Some do.
But not us.
- If I move on, who does this?
- Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
I used to have nothing.
And then I got this.
This job.
This family.
And I was... I was
better because of it.
And even though...
they're gone...
Now, I'm still
trying to be better.
I think we both
need to get a life.
You first.
Oh... Hi. Hi!
Is anyone home?
This is Scott Lang.
We met a few years ago, at the airport?
In Germany?
I got really big and
I had my mask on.
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?
Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I
know you know that.
It's the front gate.
I need to talk to you guys.
Scott.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?
Only in mid-conversation.
Alright. So...
Five years ago, right before...
Thanos,
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.
To get in there, you have to be
incredibly small. Hope, she's my...
She... she was my...
She was supposed to pull me out.
And then Thanos happened, and
- I got stuck in there.
- Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.
Yeah, but that's just it.
It wasn't.
For me it was five hours.
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.
Everything is unpredictable. Is that
anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.
Scott.
What are you talking about?
So...
What I'm saying is...
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.
The only problem is right now, we
don't have a way to navigate it.
But what if we did?
I can't stop thinking about it. What
if we could somehow control the chaos,
and we could navigate it? What if
there was a way that we can enter
the quantum realm at a certain
point in time but then
exit the quantum realm at
another point in time? Like...
Like before Thanos.
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.
It's more like a...
Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy.
It's crazy.
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...
Some wa... It's crazy.
I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,
nothing sounds crazy anymore.
So who do we talk to about this?
Chow-time!
Morgoona.
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?
- Define lunch or be disintegrated.
- Okay.
You should not be
wearing that, okay?
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.
There you go. Are you
thinking about lunch?
Want a handful of crickets?
- No.
- That's what you want.
- How did you find this?
- Garage.
Really?
- Were you looking for it?
- No.
I found it, though.
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.
Now, we know what
it sounds like...
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?
Thank you.
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.
- I did.
- No.
You accidentally survived. It's a---
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?
I don't believe we would.
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.
That means no talking to our past selves,
no betting on sporting events...
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.
'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's
not how quantum physics works.
Tony...
We have to take a stand.
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.
And you're telling me
that you won't even...
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.
Got a kid.
Mommy told me to
come and save you.
Good job. I'm saved.
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.
Anything else. Honestly, I
missed you guys, it was...
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.
But this is a second chance.
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.
I can't roll the dice again.
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?
No. I wanna do it right.
We're gonna need a
really big brain.
Bigger than his?
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating. Try some of that.
Have some eggs.
I'm so confused.
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.
I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.
Come on, step on up. You mind?
Oh.
- Say "green."
- Green.
Greeeen.
- Did you get that?
- That's good.
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...
You want to take a
picture with him, right?
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the goddamn phone.
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.
- Dab.
- Bruce.
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.
- About we were saying...
- Right.
The whole time travel do-over?
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.
Well, you pulled this off.
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?
Processing...
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.
- Gotta take a second.
- Just a moment.
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...
Model rendered.
Shit!
Shit!
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?
- Shit.
- No. We don't say that.
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.
Why you up?
'Cause I got some important shit
going on here. What do you think?
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.
That's extortion.
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...
my mind.
You done? Yeah? Now you are.
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.
A story.
Once upon a time, a little
girl went to bed. The end.
That ain't the whole story.
Come on, that's your
favorite story.
I love you tons.
I love you 3,000.
Wow.
3,000. That's crazy.
Go to bed. Or I'll
sell all your toys.
Night-night.
Not that it's a competition,
but she loves me 3,000.
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.
- What you reading?
- Just a book on composting.
What's new with composting?
- Just ....
- I figured it out...
by the way.
You know, just so we're talking
about the same thing...
Time travel.
What?
Wow.
That's...
Amazing, and.... terrifying.
That's right.
- I got really lucky.
- Yeah. I know.
- A lot of people didn't.
- No, I can't help everybody.
- It sorta seems like you can.
- Not if I stop.
I can put a pin in it
right now, and stop.
Tony...
trying to get you to stop has been one
of the few failures of my entire life.
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked
box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...
...go to bed.
But would you be able to rest?
Okay, here we go. Time
travel test number one.
Scott, fire up the, uhh...
The van thing.
Breakers are set. Emergency
generators are on standby.
Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't
wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.
You can't say things like that.
Just... it was, just a bad joke.
- You were kidding, right?
- I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.
We're good! Get your helmet on.
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week, but you'll walk
around for an hour, then bring
you back in 10 seconds.
- Makes sense?
- Perfectly not confusing.
Good luck, Scott. You got this.
You're right. I do,
Captain America.
On the count of three.
3.. 2.. 1..
Guys? This doesn't feel right.
- What's going on? Hold on.
- Who is that?
- Is that Scott?
- Yes, it's Scott!
Ooh! My back!
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it!
A baby.
- It's Scott.
- As a baby!
Bring Scott back.
When I say kill the
power, kill the power.
And... kill it!
Somebody peed my pants.
I don't know if it was
"baby" me or "old" me.
Or, just "me" me.
Time travel!
What?
I see this as an absolute win.
Why the long face?
